"""Instruction on how to create the paths.py."""
# For some tasks/scripts paths to specific folders are needed. These paths are located in the paths.py file.
# Every user needs to create their own paths.py in their local repository of the materialdatabase.
# First step is to create a new .py-file with the name paths.py. The file needs to be located in the same folder as this example-file.
# Second step is to copy and paste the content of this file into the new paths.py file.
# Final step is to replace the value None with the specific path to the needed folder.


# IMPORTANT: This file is getting tracked by Git. paths.py is included in the .gitignore and will not be tracked.
